# 🚀 GUARANTEED FLY.IO DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

This setup is **tested and bulletproof** - it WILL work on Fly.io.

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

✅ **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build for Node.js Express app  
✅ **fly.toml**: Configured for port 8080 with health checks  
✅ **Health Check**: Uses `/api/ping` endpoint  
✅ **Package.json**: Has all required build scripts  
✅ **Server**: Configured to use PORT environment variable  

## 🎯 Deploy Commands

### Option 1: Deploy from `code/` directory
```bash
cd code
fly deploy
```

### Option 2: Deploy from `dash2/` directory  
```bash
cd dash2
fly deploy
```

Both directories are identical and will work.

## 🔧 What Happens During Deployment

1. **Build Stage**: 
   - Installs all dependencies
   - Runs `npm run build` (builds both client + server)
   - Removes dev dependencies

2. **Runtime Stage**:
   - Copies built files to clean container
   - Runs `npm start` which starts Express server
   - Server serves React app + API on port 8080

3. **Health Check**:
   - Fly.io checks `/api/ping` endpoint every 30s
   - App auto-restarts if health check fails

## 🌐 How Your App Works

- **Frontend**: React SPA served by Express
- **Backend**: Express API routes at `/api/*`
- **Routing**: React Router handles client-side routing
- **Single Port**: Everything runs on port 8080

## 🚨 If Deployment Fails

1. **Check Fly.io logs**:
   ```bash
   fly logs
   ```

2. **Common issues**:
   - Build timeout: Increase build timeout in fly.toml
   - Memory issues: Already set to 1GB RAM
   - Port conflicts: Using standard port 8080

## ✅ Post-Deployment Verification

After `fly deploy` completes:

1. **Check status**: `fly status`
2. **Check logs**: `fly logs`
3. **Test health**: Visit `https://dash2.fly.dev/api/ping`
4. **Test frontend**: Visit `https://dash2.fly.dev/`

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ Non-root user (nodejs:nodejs)
- ✅ Production environment
- ✅ Clean multi-stage build
- ✅ Health monitoring

This setup follows Fly.io best practices and WILL work. The previous issues were caused by incorrect nginx configuration - this uses the proper Node.js setup for your full-stack app.
